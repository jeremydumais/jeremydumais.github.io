From the man page, here's the definition of Valgrind : Valgrind is a flexible program for debugging and profiling Linux executables. It consists of a core, which provides a
synthetic CPU in software, and a series of debugging and profiling tools.

It can does many things, but in this post we will focus on the memcheck tool which is the default.

## A few Valgrind options

The main option which interest us is **leak-check**. The four values below are available : 

- **no** : The check will be disabled.
- **summary** (default) : Will tell you how many leaks occurred,but without any details.
- **yes** or **full** : Will provides details of each individual leak found.

We will use the value **full** for our different tests.

Another that will be useful is the **show-leak-kinds** option. 

You can specify **all** of a combination of comma separated list of values : **definite** (default), 
**indirect**, **possible** (default) and **reachable**. We will see in details each type of leak later.

The **show-error-list=yes (-s)** option will show the list of detected errors and the list of used 
suppressions at exit. 

Finally, the **quiet (-q)** option will only print error messages so there will be no Valgrind header, Heap 
summary and Leak summary.

## Different kind of leaks

*We will take the time to analyze the complete log of Valgrind via the Definite section and for the 
other sections we will go more briefly*

### Definite

This kind of leak appears when you forgot to delete an allocated memory block and that you cannot
delete anymore.

Here's an example of a definite leak. The getRandomInt function generate a number between min and
max, assigne that value to a new int allocated on the heap and returns only the value. I know it's 
pretty stupid to do this, but it's only demo purpose. :)

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <random>

int getRandomInt(int min, int max)
{
    std::random_device rand_dev;
    std::default_random_engine rand_engine(rand_dev());
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> uniform_dist(min, max);
    int *retval = new int(uniform_dist(rand_engine));
    return *retval;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The random number is " <<  getRandomInt(1, 5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here is the result of running the application with valgrind with **show-leak-kinds=definite**.

```bash

```

Let's analyze this log. First in the header, Valgrind informs us that we are using the Memcheck tool.
Then we can see the HEAP SUMMARYÂ section, as the name suggests, sums up all the heap usage while
the software is running.

```bash
==195035== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==195035== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
==195035== Using Valgrind-3.18.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==195035== Command: ./build/valgrind_demo
==195035== 
```

The next part is the output produced by our program during it's execution.

```bash
The random number is 4
==195035==
```

After come the heap summary. This section sums up all the heap allocated block that occurred during
program execution.

```bash
==195035== HEAP SUMMARY:
==195035==     in use at exit: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==195035==   total heap usage: 3 allocs, 2 frees, 73,732 bytes allocated
==195035==
```

The next part is the detail section. This is where the leaks will be reported. For example on this
one we can see that 1 block of 4 bytes (the size of an int on my system) is definitely lost. Of 
course, that make sense because I didn't delete the memory allocated at the end of the function 
getRandomInt. 

```bash
==195035== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==195035==    at 0x4849013: operator new(unsigned long) (in /usr/libexec/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==195035==    by 0x10A4B3: getRandomInt(int, int) (in /home/jed/Programming/blog/valgrind/build/valgrind_demo)
==195035==    by 0x10A54B: main (in /home/jed/Programming/blog/valgrind/build/valgrind_demo)
==195035== 
```

*Note : For Valgrind to show the line numbers in your code you must compile your code with debug 
flags. In g++ it's the -g option and if you are using CMake you can configure your project with the
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug flag.*

The last part is the leak summary that sums up all the leaks that was detected while the software
was running.

```bash
==195035== LEAK SUMMARY:
==195035==    definitely lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==195035==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==195035==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==195035==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==195035==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==195035== 
==195035== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==195035== ERROR SUMMARY: 1 errors from 1 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

### Indirect



```c++
struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *parent;
};

int main()
{
    node *childItem = new node { .number = 1, .parent = new node { .number = 0, .parent = nullptr } };
    childItem = nullptr;
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
==6397== 16 bytes in 1 blocks are indirectly lost in loss record 1 of 2
==6397==    at 0x4842003: operator new(unsigned long) (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==6397==    by 0x1091A8: main (main.cpp:11)
==6397== 
==6397== LEAK SUMMARY:
==6397==    definitely lost: 16 bytes in 1 blocks
==6397==    indirectly lost: 16 bytes in 1 blocks
```
