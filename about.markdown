Hello, my name is Jérémy Dumais and I'm a software development passionate since my very beginnings in elementary school. 

The first programming language I discovered was QuickBasic. It was with QB that I learned the basics of programming such as variables, conditions, loops, I/O, etc. 

It was in 5th grade of High school that I began my C++ language initiation and this learning lasted throughout my school years at the Cégep de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue. 
This is where I followed my Computer Science training (Analyst/Programmer). 

After that, once on the job market, I had the opportunity to realize all kinds of projects and work with all sorts of languages (C/C++/C#) and technologies (Linux, MSSQL, WinApp, WebApp etc.). 

Always aiming to go further, I followed several Microsoft certifications and in summer of 2020, I completed my Certificate in Computer Science at Université Laval.
